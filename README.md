# Learning-C

In this project, I followed instructions from "Sams Teach Yourself C in 21 days" (sixth edition) book.

## How to compile the code?
First of all, you have to install GCC.

On Ubuntu:
> sudo apt-get update

> sudo apt-get install build-essential 


On CentOS:
> sudo yum update

> sudo yum groupinstall "Development Tools"


On Fedora:
> sudo dnf update

> sudo dnf groupinstall "Development Tools"


On OSX:
> You have to install XCode from AppStore
